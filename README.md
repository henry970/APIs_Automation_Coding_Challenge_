**Observation**

During testing, it was noted that the response time for several endpoints exceeded the standard threshold (500 ms). This delay in response impacted real-time data retrieval and could affect the performance of applications relying on the Marketstack API for quick data updates. Further investigation may be needed to identify the cause and optimize response times.
